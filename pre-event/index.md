The workshop segment is designed to help aid participants for the main competition during the Conference Day. Participants are first advised to **go through the lessons** materials posted at their own convenience. A **Q&A session** will then be held **weekly at *ClassDo*** by the respective speakers to help clarify participants’ doubts of the particular week’s topic.
